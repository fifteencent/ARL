# ARL
This folder contains various ARL projects (written in Python): 
1. Kalman filter implementation using randomly generated points, with animation in Manim. 
2. ML algorithm using data from the Somerville Happiness Survey (sklearn).
3. Active sonar equation implementation and animation using Manim.
## Running Animations
In order to run the Kalman filter (1) and active sonar equation (3) animations, the user must first be able to run [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) (a Python animation engine), and move the ARL folder into the main manim folder.
